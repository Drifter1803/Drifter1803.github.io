THIS CHAPTER IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!!  IT IS CURRENTLY VOLATILE, AND SHOULD BE RECTIFIED AND RECONSTRUCTED BEFORE USE.  NOTES BELOW ARE TO BE USED IN RECOMNSTRUCTION



you feel what i say alter your reality.  --->  you will agree with whatever i say your reality is
	reality doesn't actually alter, so in her brain she feels the disconnect.  if I shift the focus to her AGREEING with it, then she 	knows to shift her thinking and agree with me, and that should not cause the same disconnect


leave the wings and the halo alone for now.  sensory stuff like that will be hard to implement and likely require actual physical touch to impart some of the sensations needed to make it feel visceral.  PLUS, Winnie conceptualizes the halo way differently, and I want it to match how she thinks of it
	ADDITION: halo could be collar?
