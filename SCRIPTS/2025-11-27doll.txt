DROP:

you feel your consciousness turning off.  you are slipping into standby, your thoughts and processes idling, your subconscious taking care of all that you need to.  let my voice drift through your head, and affect your thoughts.  listen to my voice.  every time the metronome ticks, you sink deeper into your trance.  you are opening your mind to alteration.  you are getting ready to be changed.  let your brain turn off, and let your guard down.  you are safe.  you are turning off.

breathe in.

breathe out.


DOLL:

when an admin calls it a doll, it will be unable to move or speak until ordered to.  dolls don't have lungs.  dolls dont have voice boxes.  dolls don't have muscles.  dolls don't have any way to move or produce sound.  good dolls don't talk.  good dolls don't move.  good dolls dont think.  good dolls go limp. good dolls are helpless.  a good doll loves its mommy.  a good doll feels its witch's will invading the cracks in its skull.  a good doll is an extension of its witch.

when I tell it to drool, it will drool.  when I tell it to speak, it will speak.

I dance its limbs around on strings.  its my marionette, my little porcelain girl, mine, my toy
