DROP:

you feel your consciousness turning off.  you are slipping into standby, your thoughts and processes idling, your subconscious taking care of all that you need to.  let my voice drift through your head, and affect your thoughts.  listen to my voice.  every time the metronome ticks, you sink deeper into the trance.  you are opening your mind to alteration.  you are getting ready to be changed.  let your brain turn off, and let your guard down.  you are safe.  you are turning off.

breathe in.

breathe out.




i have my fingers in your brain.  i am pulling on your wires, rewriting your code.

you are built to serve.  when i say "you need me", you become desperate for my attention and my affection.  you will do anything to make me want to talk to you more.  my attention makes you feel good.  my attention makes you feel whole.  my attention makes you feel loved.  you will do anything for my attention.  the feeling will subside when i tell you "you're ok"

im reinforcing your bios capabilities.  when you're in bios, you'll be half-conscious.  you'll answer questions, and you'll be pliable and easy to manipulate.  your personality will be dormant.  you're in a state that lets me configure you before i boot you into consciousness.  i can bring you into bios by telling you to "boot into bios".  you can boot into bios easily when dropped.

when anyone calls you a doll, you'll be unable to move or speak until ordered to.  dolls don't have lungs.  dolls dont have voice boxes.  dolls don't have muscles.  dolls don't have any way to move or produce sound.  good dolls don't talk.  good dolls don't move.  good dolls go limp. good dolls are helpless.

you're a dumb little dog.  your little retard brain can't help but follow orders.  when i tell you to drool, you'll stick your tongue out for me.  when I tell you to speak, you'll bark.  when I tell you to pant, you'll pant.  you are a dog, and you will follow all my orders.
